  <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Resource-Based Theory</h2>

  <h3>What is Resource-Based Theory?</h3>
  <p>
    Resource-based theory (RBT) is a strategic management framework that describes how firms can gain and sustain a competitive advantage by focusing on their internal resources and capabilities instead of external market conditions (Jugdev, 2004). RBT suggests that a company’s success lies in identifying, developing, and leveraging unique resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and well-organized (Jugdev, 2004). Resource-based view (RBV) is a component of RBT that emphasizes the importance of internal capabilities in influencing its position in the market (Svejvig & Schlichter, 2021).
  </p>
  <h3>A Brief History of Resource-Based Theory</h3>
  <p>
    In the past, strategic models, such as Porter’s Five Forces emphasized external environment and RBT was a shift toward an internal perspective. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1959: </strong> Penrose introduces the idea that a firm’s growth depends on its internal resources (Jugdev, 2004).</li>
    <li><strong>1984: </strong> Wernerfelt introduces the term resource-based view (RBV) to describe firms using resources as a key strategy (Jugdev, 2004).</li>
    <li><strong>1991: </strong> Barney introduces the VRIN framework (Jugdev, 2004).</li>
    <li><strong>1995: </strong> Barney redefines VRIN to VRIO, emphasizing the need for organizational support (Jugdev, 2004).</li>
    <li><strong>2000s: </strong> Dynamic capabilities were introduced, and RBT became a core theory in strategy management.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>RBT vs. Traditional Strategy Models </h3>
  <p>
    This table compares RBT with Porter’s Five Forces to highlight how each approach shapes strategic thinking from different perspectives, internal vs. external.

  <h3>Why RBT Matters Today</h3>
  <p>
    Today, reacting to market forces is no longer enough. RBT emphasizes the importance of protecting key resources such as human capital, proprietary technology, brand reputation, and organizational culture (Azevedo et al., 2022). These strategic assets are often difficult for competitors to copy, making them essential to long-term success. Firms that are adaptable, resilient and innovative maintain an edge in dynamic markets. For example, Google’s strength isn’t its search engine, its the algorithms and culture of innovation.
