  <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Resource-Based Theory</h2>

  <p>
    Resource-based theory (RBT) is a strategic management framework that describes how firms can gain and sustain a competitive advantage by focusing on their internal resources and capabilities instead of external market conditions (Jugdev, 2004). RBT suggests that a companyâ€™s success lies in identifying, developing, and leveraging unique resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and well-organized (Jugdev, 2004). This can drive long-term success and differentiate it from competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resource-based view (RBV) is a component of RBT that emphasizes the importance of internal capabilities in influencing its position in the market (Svejvig &amp; Schlichter, 2021). The VRIO Framework is a tool used within RBV to evaluate whether a resource can offer a sustainable competitive advantage. Only resources that meet all four criteria are considered strategic assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    RBT emphasizes the importance of protecting key resources such as human capital, proprietary technology, brand reputation, and organizational culture (Azevedo et al., 2022). These strategic assets are often difficult for competitors to copy, making them essential to long-term success. This theory has its limitations, as it may cause firms to overlook external threats and shifts in the market.
  </p>
  <p>
    To remain competitive, firms must invest in and protect their valuable resources, as well as maintain adaptability (Azevedo et al., 2022). By continuously evaluating and refining their core competencies, organizations can build a solid foundation for innovation, resilience, and sustainable growth.
