  <h2>Module 4: Sustainable Competitive Advantage (SCA)</h2>

  <p>
    A firm achieves a competitive advantage when it delivers greater value than its competitors and can be achieved by brand loyalty, lower cost, differentiation, etc.  Sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) occurs when a firm consistently achieves success over time by leveraging internal resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and organizationally supported (Huang et al., 2015). An internal resource can be leveraged for SCA if it meets the requirements outlined in the VRIO Framework. While these resources must be valuable and strategically integrated into the firm, what makes them sustainable is the firm's ability to continuously adapt and build upon them in dynamic environments.

  <p>
    Firms initially gain temporary competitive advantage (TCA) through market position such as, entering the market early or cost leadership (Huang et al., 2020). These successes must be used strategically to reinvest into developing resources and capabilities to transition to SCA (Huang et al., 2020). SCA is not about the right tools or assets, it involves converting temporary success into firm-specific capabilities such as innovation and continuous improvement that are hard to imitate (Huang et al., 2020). This transition is most successful when firms focus on long-term technological competencies and capabilities rather than relying on the current market (Huang et al., 2020).

  <p>
    Jugdev explores how SCA applies specifically to project management. It’s more than specific tools or techniques; it’s about how these are used as a part of the organization’s culture, values, and way of working (Jugdev, 2004). Project management tools only help create SCA when they are integrated into how a company thinks and operates (Jugdev, 2004). The real source of long-term advantage comes from intangible resources such as trust, leadership, shared knowledge, and a shared way of thinking (Jugdev, 2004). These elements are not visible or easy to replicate, but are critical for long-term success.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jugdev (2004) uses a genome analogy to explain this idea. In this analogy:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <li>Tools and techniques are the “genes.”</li>
    <li>Social systems, culture, and relationships are the “hydrogen bonds” that hold the genes together and bring them to life.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When these elements are in the company’s internal systems and culture, it forms a competitive advantage that others can’t easily replicate (Jugdev, 2004).
  </p>

  <p>
    SCA is more than having the right resources; it’s about how well those resources are built, connected, and protected within the organization (Jugdev, 2004). It requires continuous investment, adaptability, and a future-thinking strategy to ensure that the current success can extend. This includes investment and protection of resources such as patents, innovation, and employee retention. While market conditions change, businesses that evolve their capabilities and refine their internal strengths can sustain long-term success and stay ahead of competitors (Huang et al., 2020).
