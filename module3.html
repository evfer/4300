  <h2>Module 3: VRIO Framework </h2>

  <p>
    The VRIO Framework is a strategic tool used to evaluate a firm’s internal resources and determine which ones can offer a sustainable competitive advantage. This framework helps companies evaluate whether a specific resource or capability can contribute meaningfully to their success (Jugdev, 2004).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    VRIO stands for:
  </p>
  
  <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <li><strong>Valuable:</strong> Does the resource allow the company to improve efficiency or effectiveness?</li>
    <li><strong>Rare:</strong> Is the resource uncommon or unique within the industry?</li>
    <li><strong>Inimitable:</strong> Is it difficult for competitors to copy or acquire the resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Organized:</strong> Is the company structured and managed in a way that allows it to fully use the resource?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If a resource meets all four criteria, it can be a long-term driver of success, helping firms outperform competitors consistently. Examples include proprietary technology, a well-known brand, efficient processes, or a strong organizational culture (Azevedo et al., 2022).

  <p>This diagram shows how different combinations of VRIO attributes lead to varying levels of competitive advantage, from parity to long-term advantage.</p>
  <p>
    RBT argues that what sets organizations apart is not just the environment they operate in, but the internal resources and capabilities they develop and deploy (Svejvig &amp; Schlichter, 2021). Moreover, it provides the theoretical foundation, and VRIO offers a practical way to apply it by asking targeted questions about the firm’s capabilities (Jugdev, 2004).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By applying the VRIO framework, businesses can prioritize internal strengths, analyze resources, and make more informed strategic decisions (Ghapanchi et al., 2014). It encourages a deeper understanding of how internal capabilities align with goals and helps firms focus on what truly sets them apart (Ghapanchi et al., 2014).
