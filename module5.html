  <h2>Module 5: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Limitations of Resource-Based Theory</h2>

  <h3>Advantages of RBT</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <li>
      <strong>Focus on internal resources:</strong> RBT emphasizes the unique internal resources of a firm over external market conditions (Jugdev, 2004).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sustainable competitive advantage:</strong> By highlighting the importance of resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and organized (VRIO), RBT enables firms to achieve long-term competitive advantages that are difficult for rivals to replicate (Jugdev, 2004).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Strategic resource allocation:</strong> Encourages firms to strategically allocate resources to high-value initiatives, encouraging efficient use of assets and improved performance (Ghapanchi et al., 2014).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexibility across industries:</strong> RBT can be applied in different industries, as it focuses on internal capabilities rather than industry-specific items.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Disadvantages of RBT</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <li>
      <strong>Ignore external factors:</strong> RBT emphasizes internal resources and capabilities, but it limits applicability in dynamic environments, where external factors play a big role (Svejvig &amp; Schlichter, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Static perspective:</strong> It is assumed that resources remain stable over time; however, in reality, dynamic markets require continuous adaptation (Huang et al., 2020).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High resource development costs:</strong> Building and sustaining valuable, unique resources can be both expensive and time-consuming.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations of RBT</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <li>
      <strong>Ignore market dynamics:</strong> RBT does not fully consider external market forces, such as economic trends and geopolitical risks. In public healthcare, traditional market forces like economic trends and competition are not as important (Svejvig &amp; Schlichter, 2021). There is a need to adapt RBT to public value instead of profit (Svejvig &amp; Schlichter, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assumes resource immobility:</strong> The theory assumes that resources cannot be easily transferred, though in practice, many resources can be (Jugdev, 2004).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>RBT is useful for analyzing internal strengths, however, in volatile industries like tech and finance, firms must be responsive to external pressures such as regulation, consumer shifts, and disruptive innovations. In these environments, hybrid strategies that combine RBT with externally focused models such as, Porterâ€™s Five Forces, are often more effective. For example, a company that focuses only on internal capabilities may miss market shifts driven by technological breakthroughs or political events. </p>

    <div>
      <p><strong>1. One criticism of RBT is that it takes a "static perspective," what does this mean?</strong></p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> A) It fails to recognize the cost of maintaining resources.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> B) It overlooks long-term strategy and focuses only on short-term profits.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> C) It assumes that resources remain stable over time, despite the reality of dynamic markets.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> D) It ignores both internal and external factors affecting the firm.</label><br>
      <span id="feedback-q1"></span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>2. Why is RBT considered limited in certain sectors like public healthcare, according to Svejvig & Schlichter (2021)?</strong></p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> A) Public healthcare relies mostly on tangible resources.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> B) Economic trends and traditional market forces are less relevant in such sectors.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> C) Healthcare organizations are not allowed to compete.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> D) Internal resources cannot be measured in the public sector.</label><br>
      <span id="feedback-q2"></span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>3. A well-established tech company has invested in its design team, which was once a major competitive advantage. Over time, many competitors have built similar capabilities and market demands are also rapidly evolving. What should the company do?
        </strong></p>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> A) Continue relying on its design team, assuming their past success will carry forward.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> B) Reduce investment in design and shift focus to external advertising.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> C) Reassess and evolve its internal resources to stay aligned with market changes and maintain relevance.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> D) Sell off its design assets to competitors who now match its capabilities.</label><br>
