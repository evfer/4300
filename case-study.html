          <h2>Case Study: JPMorgan Chase’s Agile RBT Approach</h2>
  
          <p>
            In Agile project management, success often depends on effectively utilizing internal resources—whether it's people, technology, or knowledge—to drive efficiency and deliver value to a team or firm (Ouriques et al., 2018). The resource-based theory (RBT) provides a useful framework for this approach, as it emphasizes that a company's unique resources can be used for sustained competitive advantage when they are valuable, rare, difficult to replicate, and well-organized (VRIO framework) (Jugdev, 2004). JPMorgan Chase's journey to becoming the top-ranked commercial bank in the USA is a great example of how an organization can use RBT principles in Agile project management to enhance resources to gain a competitive advantage.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When Jamie Dimon became CEO in 2005, JPMorgan Chase wanted to improve how it managed internal skills and resources to meet strategic goals (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). The company started a Resource Inventory Initiative (RII), an internal database that documents employee skills, training, and competencies. Much like an Agile team that uses backlogs and retrospectives to improve constantly, this database allowed JPMorgan Chase to consistently improve, assess skill gaps, and align employees to the right project that suits them best (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). This process reflects Agile's emphasis on continuous improvement, adaptability, and creativity, ensuring that resources are efficiently utilized to maximize productivity and innovation (Ouriques et al., 2018).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One project where this Agile, RBT-driven approach made a difference was the Cardiff Collateral Management System (CCMS). By analyzing skill gaps using the RII system, JPMorgan Chase identified the need to either upskill current employees or bring in third-party experts for this project (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). This reflects Agile practices, where teams assess their capabilities and make real-time adjustments to enhance outcomes. Instead of a rigid, long-term plan, JPMorgan strategically reassigned employees who were fit for the job, provided targeted training, and strategically recruited a talented team—all due to their unique internal resources (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Another Agile concept JPMorgan Chase utilized was flexible and adaptable planning. JPMorgan Chase realized they lacked a strong West Coast presence, which was holding them back from their goal of becoming the top commercial bank (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). Instead of taking a slow method of trying to expand out west, the company moved to a more agile solution of leveraging mergers and acquisitions to acquire its presence (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). This is similar to how an Agile team would use existing frameworks, third-party resources, or online services instead of building everything from scratch, which is what they would have been forced into doing if they hadn't taken an Agile approach and merged. Specifically, during the financial crisis of 2008, JPMorgan Chase used this strategy by buying out struggling banks and gaining market share without the time and cost of building new branches from the ground up (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By applying an Agile mindset within the RBT framework, JPMorgan Chase successfully optimized its unique internal resources, improved collaboration, and used real-time planning to adapt quickly to industry challenges. The strategies resulted in JPMorgan's revenue increasing by 155% between 2004 and 2017 and positioned the company as the leading U.S. commercial bank (Donnellan &amp; Rutledge, 2019). This case study highlights a lesson for companies that use Agile and RBT frameworks: organizations that constantly leverage their unique internal resources, embrace real-time flexible planning, and strategically align their people with business needs will achieve long-term success (Leybourne, 2009). Resources are always evolving, so make yours stand out to face new challenges.
